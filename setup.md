# Setup

### Setup the Go programming language distribution
[Install the Go language distribution](https://golang.org/doc/install) 
on your development machine. Go 1.13 or higher is preferred. 

### Setup your development environmnet for Go
Most popular text editors and many IDEs offer enhanced development 
support for Go like syntax highlighting, code auto-formatting on save
and auto-completion. Choose the programming text editor or IDE you
may be most familiar with and install Go language support:
- Official [Editor Plugins and IDEs](https://golang.org/doc/editors.html) page
- [Community maintained Editors and IDEs wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins)

### Get familiar code the development processs in Go
This tutorial assumes you have a working knowledge of Go and will not
teach basic language concepts and development workflows. If you are
new to Go, please ensure you have gone through at least the following:
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org)
- [How to write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

You may also find [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) and 
[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) to be valuable
learning resources.

### Setup your development environment
It is recommended that you create a git repository to version control
your source code and revert in case of major errors etc. If you have 
done so, then start your development by cloning the repository
(eg in Github or Gitlab) to your computer.
```
$ git clone <path to your repository>
```

Alternatively, create a directory for your project
```
$ mkdir gokilo
```
